Simple_Different Similar In human cells, enhancer and promoter sequences are broadly compatible, as enhancers can activate many different promoter sequences similarly, leading to a multiplicative effect on RNA output. This compatibility is supported by studies showing that nearly all active enhancers can activate all promoter sequences by similar amounts. However, in Drosophila, the situation is different; while both housekeeping and developmentally regulated gene promoters can be responsive, they respond to distinct sets of enhancer sequences and cofactors. This indicates that the compatibility model for enhancers and promoters in humans does not directly apply to Drosophila, where there are greater preferences for different classes of enhancers based on the type of promoter. s41586-022-04877-w.pdf	yes, no

Simple_Same Same The expression of human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) with an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence has a complex effect on yeast cell phenotype. While the αPrePro sequence increased sensitivity to agonists like DAMGO and morphine by roughly two-fold, it also caused significant cellular disruptions. These disruptions included enlarged granular cells, expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and the relocalization of HsMOR-GFP to puncta. Additionally, the maximum size of the signaling population decreased by 72%, indicating that despite the improved sensitivity, the overall signaling competency was reduced due to cellular stress and potential misfolding of HsMOR-GFP. Therefore, while the αPrePro sequence had some positive effects on sensitivity, the associated negative impacts on cell phenotype and signaling population rendered it not beneficial overall. s41467-022-30570-7.pdf	Enlarged granular cells

Simple_Same Same The laminar patterns of axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons are more diffuse compared to Layer 2-4 intratelencephalic neurons. This is indicated by the observation that deep somata (which include lower Layer 5/Layer 6 neurons) tend to project more diffusely, while upper and middle somata (which correspond to Layer 2-4 neurons) have more focal projections. Specifically, upper/middle somata focus their axonal terminations in a smaller area, while deep somata exhibit a more widespread pattern of axonal termination. {2023.02.18.528865v2.full.pdf}	More diffuse

Simple_Different Same Microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of monkeys have been shown to induce a negative bias in decision-making that persists in subsequent decision-making experiments. Specifically, the microstimulation increased the average avoidance (Av) choices significantly in a number of sessions, indicating a tendency towards more avoidant behavior. This negative bias was associated with a decrease in functional connectivity from cognitive regions (like the dlPFC) to limbic regions, suggesting that the disruption of top-down influence from the dlPFC could lead to difficulties in emotion regulation and affective decision-making. The findings indicate that the activation of specific neurons in the sgACC contributes to this negative bias, which is sustained even after the stimulation has ceased, affecting later decision-making processes. {s41467-024-48375-1.pdf}	They maintain a negative bias

Simple_Same Same The human SNVs French 2 and Indian 2 both lead to a subtle increase in the affinity of the transcription factor ETS-1 to the ETS-A site in DNA. Specifically, the relative affinity increases from 0.15 in the reference to 0.24 in French 2 and 0.26 in Indian 2. This increase in affinity is confirmed by EMSA, which shows that both variants bind to ETS-1 more strongly than the wild-type ETS-A. The similar phenotypes associated with these variants suggest that they may affect the same underlying mechanism related to polydactyly. s41586-023-06922-8.pdf	subtle increase

Simple_Different Same Knocking out DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) in neurons leads to a significant increase in repeat-derived RNA expression, particularly from IAP (intracisternal A particle) elements. This is evidenced by a dramatic 200-fold induction of IAPs in DNMT–TKO neurons, which then comprise one-third of the total repeat-derived RNA. The absence of DNA methylation allows for the upregulation of these elements, which also impacts the expression of neighboring genes. Additionally, the lack of DNA methylation activates genes controlled by methylated CpG islands and causes extensive transcription of retrotransposons specifically in neurons. The transcription factor CREB1 plays a crucial role in this process, as it binds to new sites in the absence of DNA methylation, leading to increased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of repeat-derived RNA. s41588-022-01241-6.pdf	strong increase

Simple_Different Same Pexmetinib significantly increases the rate of threonine dephosphorylation by WIP1 phosphatase. Specifically, it enhances the dephosphorylation of pT180 by 10-fold. This effect is attributed to pexmetinib's ability to flip the activation loop of p38α, which exposes the pT180 site to solvent, making it more accessible for WIP1 to dephosphorylate. The conformation of the activation loop is crucial for determining the dephosphorylation rate, and while tyrosine phosphorylation can promote this process, it is not strictly necessary for pexmetinib's action. {2024.05.15.594272v3.full.pdf}	Increases dephosphorylation

To ensure that the samples remain invariant under these symmetry operations throughout the sampling process, they symmetrized the initial structure and defined a symmetrized 'copying' operation. Additionally, they modified the sampling operation to include a symmetrized stochastic differential equation (SDE) that incorporates symmetry conditions, allowing for the generation of structures that meet the symmetry requirements. {2022.12.01.518682v1.full.pdf}	symmetric sampling of the SDE/ODE (analytical conditioning)

Specifically, EPRS1(N1) inhibits the binding of the GAIT complex to target mRNAs, which is important for regulating the expression of proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). By shielding GAIT-element-bearing transcripts from the inhibitory effects of the GAIT complex, EPRS1(N1) ensures that low-level expression of GAIT target proteins is maintained, which is essential for homeostasis. s12276-023-01094-x.pdf	polyadenylation

Simple_Different Same The inter-individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (NF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) could be explained by several training characteristics within the target brain region and beyond. Notably, while specific characteristics such as mean NF signal amplitude and mean left amygdala activation were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms, the variability in treatment efficacy may be attributed to whole-brain activation patterns during self-regulation training, which extend beyond the amygdala. Additionally, significant symptom reduction was linked to selective increases in control regions like lateral prefrontal areas and decreases in default mode areas associated with self-referential thinking. The presence of multiple brain functional pathways to successful treatment suggests that the regulation process itself is crucial for achieving treatment success and understanding the variability in outcomes. Furthermore, individuals who did not respond effectively to feedback signals exhibited non-responsiveness, indicating the importance of brain response to feedback in effective NF training. {2024.05.01.592108v2.full.pdf}	None of the above
