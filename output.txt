Arg312's positively charged side chain reaches halfway into the tunnel, while Arg314 occupies a nearby outer vestibule at the tunnel’s entrance.File Sources:- {2024.05.14.593970v1.full.pdf}	Arg312

Simple_Different Evaluation:Different Response:The ribosomal RNA modification enzymes that have been found to promote large ribosomal subunit assembly even when expressed as a catalytically dead mutant are the methyltransferases. Specifically, the enzymes that have been studied in this context include the methyltransferases that modify rRNA, which play a role in the structural integrity and assembly of the ribosomal subunits.File Sources:No information.

Simple_Different Evaluation:Different Response:The inter-individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (NF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) could be explained by variations in whole-brain activation patterns during self-regulation training, as well as the identification of subtypes of regulation activation and brain responses to feedback signals. Specifically, subtypes associated with significant symptom reduction were characterized by selective increases in control regions and decreases in self-referential thinking areas. Additionally, individuals classified within the FBR0 subtype, who were non-responsive to feedback signals, did not experience significant symptom reduction, indicating the critical role of brain response to feedback signals in effective NF training.
