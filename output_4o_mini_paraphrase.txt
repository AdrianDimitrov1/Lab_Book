Simple_Different Same Microstimulation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in monkeys induced a negative bias in decision-making, particularly in approach-avoidance tasks. This negative bias was evidenced by a significant increase in avoidance choices during both the immediate stimulation phase and the follow-up phase, indicating that the effects of the microstimulation persisted beyond the immediate intervention. Additionally, the microstimulation reduced the directional influence of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) on limbic regions, which may have contributed to the observed negative bias. The loss of top-down influence from the dlPFC to cingulo-striatal regions was also associated with this negative bias, suggesting a mechanism by which cognitive control can regulate emotional responses. Furthermore, changes in beta oscillation signaling within the fronto-cingulo-striatal network were linked to the negative bias in decision-making, highlighting the role of neural oscillations in these processes. s41467-024-48375-1.pdf	They maintain a negative bias

Simple_Same Similar The French 2 and Indian 2 variants lead to a subtle increase in the affinity of the ETS-A site to 0.24 and 0.26, respectively. This increase in affinity is associated with a gain of function (GOF) that disturbs the balance of activators and repressors, which can lead to developmental defects such as polydactyly due to ectopic expression of genes like Shh and Ptch1 in the anterior limb bud. However, EMSA results indicate that there is no significant difference in the binding of ETS-1 to the French 2, Indian 2, or a synthetic variant with similar affinity. s41586-023-06922-8.pdf	subtle increase

In DNMT–TKO neurons, there is a 200-fold induction of IAPs, which make up one-third of the repeat-derived RNA and influence the expression of neighboring genes. This increase is associated with the activation of genes controlled by methylated CpG islands and the rampant transcription of retrotransposons, indicating that the absence of DNA methylation leads to increased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation. s41588-022-01241-6.pdf	strong increase

Simple_Different Similar To inhibit cell growth in fibroblasts cultured on a 0.5 kPa surface (soft acrylamide), you would need significantly less bleomycin compared to culturing on plastic. Complete inhibition of proliferation was observed at roughly 1/10th the concentration required on plastic substrates. Specifically, on the softest matrix (0.5 kPa), a modest increase in cell number was observed with 250 nM bleomycin, indicating that near total growth arrest occurs at 1/20th the required dose for plastic. Therefore, you would need a much lower concentration of bleomycin on the 0.5 kPa surface to achieve similar inhibition of cell growth. {2024.02.06.579151v2.full.pdf}	You need 10x less
