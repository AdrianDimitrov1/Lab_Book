These include enlarged granular cells, expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and the relocalization of HsMOR-GFP to puncta. These changes suggest global cellular disruptions, possibly due to partial misfolding of HsMOR-GFP.

Simple_Same Same Yes, there has been an assessment of doing tagmentation of cDNA directly in the PCR mix without cleaning and quantifying the cDNA first. This approach is part of a strategy termed Smart-seq3xpress, which allows for direct tagmentation of cDNA products after preamplification at fewer cycles, bypassing several time-consuming and expensive steps such as excessive cDNA preamplification, concentration measurements, and cDNA amount normalization. This method demonstrated robust tagmentation over large ranges of cDNA, Tn5, and reaction volumes, although it resulted in libraries biased towards 5’ reads, affecting full-transcript coverage. However, using different PCR polymerases, such as SeqAmp and PlatinumII, improved tagmentation compatibility and reduced the fraction of 5’ UMI reads, indicating better library quality and complexity. 2021.07.10.451889v1.full.pdf	Yes

Simple_Same Same The axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons in the mouse cortex are more diffuse compared to those of Layer 2-4 intratelencephalic neurons. Specifically, deep somata, which include lower Layer 5/Layer 6 neurons, mainly project to deep layers and have more diffuse projections, extending from lower layer 5 to layer 6. In contrast, upper and middle somata, which include Layer 2-4 neurons, preferentially project to upper-middle layers and have more focal projections. This indicates that the laminar patterns of axonal terminations for deep-layer neurons are less focused compared to those of upper/middle-layer neurons. 2023.02.18.528865v2.full.pdf	More diffuse

Simple_Different Same Microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of monkeys in a prior experiment induced a negative bias in decision-making during an approach-avoidance task. This was characterized by an increase in avoidance choices and a decrease in approach choices. The negative bias persisted in later decision-making experiments, as evidenced by a significant increase in avoidance choices in the Follow-up block compared to the Stim-off block.

Specifically, the affinity increases from 0.15 in the reference to 0.24 in French 2 and 0.26 in Indian 2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirm that both variants bind to ETS-1 more strongly than the wild-type ETS-A.

Specifically, complete inhibition of proliferation on the soft matrix can be achieved at roughly 1/10th the concentration required for plastic. For example, while high doses of 5 µM and 50 µM are needed to fully inhibit proliferation on plastic, on the softest matrix, a much lower concentration, such as 250 nM, can lead to a near total growth arrest, which is 1/20th the dose required on plastic. 2024.02.06.579151v2.full.pdf	You need 10x less

Simple_Different Same To implement symmetric molecular dynamics as a holonomic constraint and constrain Wyckoff sites, the dynamics need to be G-invariant up to a permutation of subunits. This means that the sampling procedure, denoted as SDESOLVE, must respect the symmetries of the group G, which includes operations like rotation, reflection, and translation. The invariance condition requires that for any symmetry operation gi in G, the transformed sample gi ·X1 should result in the same transformation applied to the output of the sampling procedure, i.e., SDESOLVE(gi ·X1) = gi ·SDESOLVE(X1). This ensures that the generated samples respect the symmetry constraints of the group, which is crucial for maintaining the symmetry of Wyckoff sites in molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, ensuring that the initial conditions and their derivatives are symmetric helps maintain these constraints throughout the simulation. 2022.12.01.518682v1.full.pdf	Lagrange multiplier constraints

Simple_Different Same In the Ingraham 2022 protein design paper, the authors ensured that protein complexes were symmetric with respect to a specific space group by using a method that involved G-invariant SDE/ODE dynamics. This approach required that the sampling procedure, denoted as SDESOLVE, be invariant under the symmetry operations of the group G, which includes operations like rotation, reflection, and translation. The sampling procedure was defined to respect these symmetries by ensuring that for any group element gi in G, the operation SDESOLVE(gi ·X1) would equal gi ·SDESOLVE(X1), maintaining the symmetry throughout the process. This method was designed to be equivariant to the permutation of subunits, ensuring that the generated protein complexes adhered to the desired symmetrical properties of the space group. 2022.12.01.518682v1.full.pdf	symmetric sampling of the SDE/ODE (analytical conditioning)

Simple_Different Same The inter-individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (NF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are not explained by training characteristics within the target brain region, such as mean NF signal amplitude or mean left amygdala activation. Instead, significant associations were found between subtypes of whole-brain activation patterns during NF training and changes in depressive symptoms, as measured by MADRS scores. Specifically, significant symptom reduction was observed in individuals whose brain activation correlated with feedback signals, either positively or negatively, depending on their regulation subtype. Subtypes associated with symptom reduction were characterized by selective increases in control regions, such as lateral prefrontal areas, and decreases in regions associated with self-referential thinking, like default mode areas. This suggests that large-scale brain activity during training is more critical for clinical efficacy than the level of activation in the neurofeedback target region itself. Overall, the therapeutic effects of NF cannot be solely attributed to changes in the activity of the target region, such as the left amygdala, but rather involve broader brain network activations. 2024.05.01.592108v2.full.pdf	None of the above

Simple_Different Different The poly(A) oligos that demonstrate the highest resistance to RNA degradation are those with chemical modifications and specific RNA topology. Specifically, construct 8, which incorporates three branches and synergistic incorporation of 2MOE and PS on both the stem and branched poly(A) oligos, shows significant resistance to degradation. This construct not only enhances luminescence signals but also benefits from chemical and topological modifications that effectively protect the poly(A) from degradation. Additionally, chemical stabilization added to all branches further increases the half-life to 130 minutes, indicating a high level of resistance to RNA degradation. s41587-024-02174-7.pdf	modified branch poly(A)
