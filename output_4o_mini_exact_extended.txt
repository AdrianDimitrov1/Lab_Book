Simple_Different Similar Enhancer and promoter sequences are broadly compatible in human cells, as enhancers can work with many RNA polymerase II promoter sequences to enhance RNA output. This compatibility is supported by observations that suggest enhancers influence gene expression through a combination of promoter activity, enhancer activity, and 3D interactions, with enhancer-promoter class compatibilities being a smaller factor. However, this model differs from Drosophila, where the responsiveness of promoters to enhancers varies significantly, with distinct sets of enhancer sequences and cofactors being involved for different types of genes. s41586-022-04877-w.pdf	yes, no

Simple_Same Same The expression of human mu-opioid receptor (HsMOR) with an N-terminal yeast αPrePro sequence has a complex effect on yeast cell phenotype. While the αPrePro sequence increased sensitivity to agonists like DAMGO and morphine by roughly two-fold, it also caused significant cellular disruptions. These disruptions included enlarged granular cells, expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and the relocalization of HsMOR-GFP to puncta. Additionally, the maximum size of the signaling population was dramatically decreased by 72%, indicating that despite the improved sensitivity, the overall signaling competency was compromised due to cellular stress and potential misfolding of HsMOR. Therefore, the αPrePro sequence, while beneficial for sensitivity, ultimately led to negative effects on the yeast cell phenotype. s41467-022-30570-7.pdf	Enlarged granular cells

Simple_Same Same Yes, there has been an assessment of doing tagmentation of cDNA directly in the PCR mix without cleaning and quantifying the cDNA first. This approach, referred to as Smart-seq3xpress, demonstrated robust tagmentation over a range of cDNA amounts and reaction volumes, allowing for the exclusion of several time-consuming steps such as excessive cDNA preamplification and concentration measurements. However, it was noted that while this method revealed similar gene detection, the resulting libraries were biased towards 5' reads, which affected the full-length coverage of transcripts. Despite these challenges, it was found that certain PCR polymerases, particularly SeqAmp, showed improved compatibility with direct tagmentation, leading to better library quality and complexity. 2021.07.10.451889v1.full.pdf	Yes

Simple_Same Same The laminar patterns of axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons are more diffuse compared to Layer 2-4 intratelencephalic neurons. This is indicated by the observation that deep somata (which include lower Layer 5/Layer 6 neurons) tend to project more diffusely, while upper somata (which correspond to Layer 2-4 neurons) focus their axonal terminations in a smaller area. Therefore, the axonal terminations of lower Layer 5/Layer 6 neurons exhibit a greater degree of diffusion in their projections. 2023.02.18.528865v2.full.pdf	More diffuse

Simple_Different Same Microstimulations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of monkeys have been shown to induce a negative bias in decision-making. Specifically, the microstimulation successfully led to a greater proportion of negative effective sites compared to positive ones, indicating that the sgACC's activity can influence decision-making negatively. Furthermore, this negative bias persisted even after the effective microstimulation had ended, as evidenced by significant results in follow-up decision-making experiments. The mean percentage change in decision-making metrics remained above the threshold for negative effective sessions, suggesting that the effects of the microstimulation were sustained in subsequent decision-making tasks. s41467-024-48375-1.pdf	They maintain a negative bias

Simple_Same Same The human SNVs French 2 and Indian 2 both cause a subtle increase in the relative affinity of the transcription factor ETS-1 to DNA. Specifically, the affinity for the ETS-A site increases from 0.15 in the reference to 0.24 in French 2 and 0.26 in Indian 2. Additionally, EMSA confirms that both variants bind to ETS-1 more strongly than the wild-type ETS-A. This increase in affinity is associated with the phenotype of preaxial polydactyly, suggesting that the mechanism driving this condition may be linked to the enhanced binding of ETS-1 due to these variants. s41586-023-06922-8.pdf	subtle increase

Simple_Different Same Knocking out DNA methyltransferase in neurons leads to a dramatic increase in repeat-derived RNA expression, particularly from IAP (intracisternal A particle) elements. This results in a 200-fold induction of IAPs, which then comprise one-third of the total repeat-derived RNA. This increase in repeat-derived RNA can also impact the expression of neighboring genes. Similar derepression effects have been observed in other contexts, such as in Dnmt1−/− embryonic stem cells and murine embryos, indicating that the upregulation of repeat-derived RNA in DNMT–TKO neurons reflects changes seen in vivo. s41588-022-01241-6.pdf	strong increase

Simple_Same Same To constrain Wyckoff sites using symmetric molecular dynamics as a holonomic constraint, the constraints are implemented as Lagrange multiplier constraints. This involves computing the terms analytically at each step, as indicated by the equations provided. Specifically, the holonomic constraint can be expressed as \( t P t tq q q 0( ) ( ) ( )σ[ ] = − = \) (equation 8), and the force from the constraint is given by \( J P IF ( )c λ σ λ= [ ] = − \) (equation 9). Here, \( J[σ] \) represents the Jacobian of \( σ \) with respect to the constraint dimension and the elements of \( q(t) \). The value of the Lagrange multiplier \( λ \) can be determined by ensuring that \( σ[q(t + Δt)] = 0 \).

This was achieved by imposing an invariance condition on the sampling procedure, which required that the sampling function, denoted as SDESOLVE, be equivariant to the group of symmetries (G) being considered. Specifically, they ensured that for any group element (gi) in G, the relationship SDESOLVE(gi ·X1) = gi ·SDESOLVE(X1) = σiSDESOLVE(X1) held true. This method allowed them to generate samples that strictly imposed the desired symmetries, including various point groups such as cyclic, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetries. However, they noted that while the sampled geometries maintained symmetry, they could sometimes exhibit poor contact between subunits. 2022.12.01.518682v1.full.pdf	symmetric sampling of the SDE/ODE (analytical conditioning)

Simple_Different Same The F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin significantly affects the binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole (TBZ). The wild-type β-tubulin binds TBZ more favorably with a contact energy of -9.9 kcal/mol, while the F200Y mutant exhibits unfavorable repulsions with a contact energy of +27.6 kcal/mol. This unfavorable binding is primarily due to repulsions caused by interactions with residues Y200, F240, L250, and L253 in the mutant. Additionally, the F200Y mutation likely forms a hydrogen bond with E198, which constricts the binding pocket and occludes TBZ binding, contributing to TBZ resistance. iyab101.pdf	Disrupts binding

Simple_Different Similar When male valvular interstitial cells (VIC) are cultured on larger polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP) gels, we can expect changes in both methylation and acetylation states. Specifically, the larger particles lead to dose-dependent and size-dependent changes in methylation, and they uniquely affect the acetylation state in males. Therefore, the expected epigenetic changes include alterations in both methylation and acetylation when cultured on larger PS-NP gels. 2024.05.13.593760v2.full.pdf	Increased acetylation relative to female VICs

Simple_Same Same The ribosomal RNA modification enzyme RlmB has been found to promote large ribosomal subunit assembly even when expressed as a catalytically dead mutant (RlmB(E198A)), stimulating ribosome biogenesis to nearly the same extent as the native RlmB. Additionally, RlmB has a modification-independent function, further supporting its role in ribosome assembly. gkae222.pdf	RlmB

Simple_Different Same The subunit of the Rev1 protein that, when knocked out in Drosophila lacking the Rev3 domain of polymerase zeta, leads to the greatest increase in sensitivity to DNA alkylation induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is the deoxycytidyl transferase activity of REV1. This is supported by the information that flies lacking REV3 require this activity of REV1 to tolerate MMS, and that rev1∆ mutants are significantly more sensitive to MMS compared to rev3∆ mutants. 2024.02.13.580051v1.full.pdf	DTD

Simple_Different Different The inter-individual differences in clinical response to real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in patients with major depressive disorder could be explained by variations in whole-brain activation patterns during self-regulation training. Specifically, significant associations were found between subtypes of whole-brain activation patterns during neurofeedback training and changes in MADRS scores, indicating that different activation patterns can influence treatment efficacy. For instance, individuals in the REG-B subtype, who exhibited increased activation in executive control areas and salience network regions, achieved symptom reduction regardless of whether their brain response to feedback signals was positive or negative. Additionally, the absence of suppressive activation during the regulation task could be offset by negative responses to feedback signals in certain brain areas, further contributing to the variability in treatment outcomes. 2024.05.01.592108v2.full.pdf	None of the above
